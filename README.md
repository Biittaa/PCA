# 🌟 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Adult Dataset

Welcome to my data mining project where I perform **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** on the widely-used **Adult dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how PCA can be used for dimensionality reduction and pattern discovery in real-world data. The main steps covered include:

- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical features  
- Normalizing numerical attributes  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Manual implementation of PCA (step-by-step)  
- Visualizing and interpreting principal components

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Insights

- PCA helped reduce the dataset to a few principal components while preserving most of the variance.  
- Clear separation between income classes was observed along the first few components.  
- Manual PCA implementation improved understanding of eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and the transformation process.
