# ðŸŒŸ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Adult Dataset

Welcome to my data mining project where I perform **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** on the widely-used **Adult dataset**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how PCA can be used for dimensionality reduction and pattern discovery in real-world data. The main steps covered include:

- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical features  
- Normalizing numerical attributes  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Manual implementation of PCA (step-by-step)  
- Visualizing and interpreting principal components

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

- PCA helped reduce the dataset to a few principal components while preserving most of the variance.  
- Manual PCA implementation improved understanding of eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and the transformation process.
